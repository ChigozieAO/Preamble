code (KOD)

Definitions :

- A system of signals used to represent letters or numbers in transmitiing messages.

- A system of symbols, letters or words given certain arbitrary meanings, used for transmitiing messages requiring secrecy or brevity.

- A system of symbols and rules used to represent instructions to a computer.

Morse code 

- This was invented by Samuel Finley Breese Morse (1791 - 1872).

code :

: A (.-) B (-...) C (-.-.) D (-..) E (.) F (..-.) G (--.) H (....) I (..) J (.---) K (-.-) L (.-..) M (--) N(-.)
  O (---) P (.--.) Q (--.-) R (.-.) S (...) T (-) U (..-) V (...-) W (.--) X (-..-) Y (-.--) Z (--..) 


Electricity 

Definitions :

- Electricity is basically the movement of electrons from one place(medium or object) to another 

- Voltage refers to a potential for doing work
- Current is related to the number of electrons actually zipping around the circuit.
- Resistance refers to the tendency of a substance to impede the flow of electrons.

/ The thicker the wire , the lower the resistance 
/ The larger the wire , the higher the resistance

* The " Water - and - Pipe " analogy : Current is similar to the amount of water flowing through a pipe. Voltage is similar to
  the water pressure. Resistance is similar to the width of a pipe - the smaller the pipe, the larger the resistance. the smaller
  the pipe, the less water that flows through it. The amount of water flowing through a pipe (the current) is directly proportional
  to the water pressure (the voltage) and inversely proportional to the skinniness of the pipe (the resistance)

' Georg Simon Ohm (1789 - 1854)
' Ohm's Law : I = E / R 

' Watt is a measurement of power ( P )
' P = E x I
