code (KOD)

Definitions :

- A system of signals used to represent letters or numbers in transmitiing messages.

- A system of symbols, letters or words given certain arbitrary meanings, used for transmitiing messages requiring secrecy or brevity.

- A system of symbols and rules used to represent instructions to a computer.

Morse code 

- This was invented by Samuel Finley Breese Morse (1791 - 1872).

code :

: A (.-) B (-...) C (-.-.) D (-..) E (.) F (..-.) G (--.) H (....) I (..) J (.---) K (-.-) L (.-..) M (--) N(-.)
  O (---) P (.--.) Q (--.-) R (.-.) S (...) T (-) U (..-) V (...-) W (.--) X (-..-) Y (-.--) Z (--..) 


Electricity 

Definitions :

- Electricity is basically the movement of electrons from one place(medium or object) to another 

- Voltage refers to a potential for doing work
- Current is related to the number of electrons actually zipping around the circuit.
- Resistance refers to the tendency of a substance to impede the flow of electrons.

/ The thicker the wire , the lower the resistance 
/ The larger the wire , the higher the resistance

* The " Water - and - Pipe " analogy : Current is similar to the amount of water flowing through a pipe. Voltage is similar to
  the water pressure. Resistance is similar to the width of a pipe - the smaller the pipe, the larger the resistance. the smaller
  the pipe, the less water that flows through it. The amount of water flowing through a pipe (the current) is directly proportional
  to the water pressure (the voltage) and inversely proportional to the skinniness of the pipe (the resistance)

' Georg Simon Ohm (1789 - 1854)
' Ohm's Law : I = E / R 

' Watt is a measurement of power ( P )
' P = E x I

Feedback and Flip Flop 

A cycle of a oscillator is defined as the interval during which the output of the oscillator changes and then comes back to where
it started.

- The time required for one cycle is called a period of the oscillator.

- The frequency of the oscillator is divided by the period.

* Heinrich Rudolph Hertz (1857 - 1894), who was the first person to transmit and recieve radio waves.

- A flip-flop circuit is one that has two stable states when both swithches are open. The flip-flop dates from 1918 with the work
  of English radio physicist william Henry Eccles and F.W Jordan.

Level-triggered D-type Latch, this simply means that the circuit latches onto one bit of data and keeps it around for further use.
which can also be referred to as a 1 - bit memory.

A circuit in which the Q(bar) output is routed back to the data input of a flip-flop is also known as a frequency divider.


Bytes and Hex

Hex to Decimal
- () x 4096 + () x 256 + () x 16 + () x 1
- () x 16^4 + () x 16^3 + () x 16^2 + () x 16^1 + () x 16^0


Memory

RAM : Read / Write Memory or Random Access Memory

- A particular configuration of RAM is often referered to as a RAM array.

-The number of values that a RAM array stores is directly related to the number of Address inputs.

- With no Address inputs, two values are possible. with two Address inputs, four values are stored.
  with three Address inputs, eight value are possible, with four Address inputs, sixteen values are stored.

Numbers of values in RAM array = 2^no of Address inputs.

8 bits = 1 byte 
1 kilobyte = 1024 bytes
1 megabyte = 1024 kilobyte
1 gigabyte = 1024 megabyte
1 terabyte = 1024 gigabyte


Automation

- Digital data is discreet data - data that has certain specific distinct values.
- Analog information is continuous and varies throughout an entire range.

- A digital compute works with discreet numbers 
- Digital computer has four main parts: a processor , memory , at least one input device, and least one output device.
